🔍 What is MySQL?
MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that organizes data into structured tables using rows and columns. It is transactional in nature—operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are grouped into transactions that only commit if every action succeeds.

Some key highlights:

Powered by the InnoDB storage engine, enabling high performance and handling of large, complex operations.

Ideal for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) with low latency and high throughput—perfect for use cases like banking and e-commerce.

Supports replication from a main server to replicas for better availability and load balancing.

Allows read scale-out, increasing performance in read-heavy applications.

Functions both as an SQL and NoSQL solution, offering flexibility in application development.

Offers advanced security and tablespace management, giving administrators fine control over data storage.
