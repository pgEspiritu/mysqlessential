# MySQL Licensing Overview

MySQL licensing is especially important for:

- **Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)**
- **Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)**
- **Value-Added Resellers (VARs)**

These groups often embed MySQL into their software or hardware solutions to enhance functionality and performance.

## License Options

- **GPL v2 License**  
  Best suited for open-source projects that are willing to share their source code publicly.

- **Commercial License (from Oracle)**  
  Preferred by companies who do not wish to open-source their code.  
  Enables proprietary use of MySQL without disclosing source code.

## Why It Matters

ISVs, OEMs, and VARs can:

- Distribute MySQL as part of their commercial products.
- Choose the appropriate license to align with business goalsâ€”open-source or proprietary.
