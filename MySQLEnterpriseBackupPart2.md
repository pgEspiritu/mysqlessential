## MySQL Enterprise Backup: Process Overview

MySQL Enterprise Backup (MEB) enables consistent and efficient backup of MySQL databases with minimal performance impact. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the backup process and restoration workflow, along with key features.

---

### 🔄 Backup Process Workflow

1. **Initial Physical Copy**
   - Copies necessary data and log files from the MySQL data directory.
   - Performed while the MySQL server is online and operational.

2. **Apply Backup Lock**
   - A low-impact backup lock ensures consistent data.
   - For non-InnoDB tables, a metadata (wed) lock is used to guarantee consistency.

3. **Capture Log Coordinates**
   - Briefly locks logging to get a consistent view of binary/redo log positions.
   - Then releases locks on non-transactional tables.

4. **Record In-Flight Transactions**
   - Gathers and records all changes that occurred during the backup window using the previously captured log coordinates.

5. **Release Backup Lock**
   - Once data and logs are captured, the backup lock is removed.

6. **Save Metadata**
   - Final metadata such as backup timestamp and contents are recorded.

7. **Backup Output**
   - Saved to a specified directory or image file.
   - Includes:
     - InnoDB tablespace and redo logs
     - Per-table InnoDB files
     - Non-InnoDB data files (e.g., MyISAM)
     - MySQL log and instance configuration files

### 🔁 Restore Process

> ⚠️ Before restoring, ensure the data directory is **clean**. The restore will fail if existing files are present.

#### Full Backup Restore:
```bash
mysqlbackup --defaults-file=conf.cnf --backup-dir=/backups/full backup
mysqlbackup --defaults-file=conf.cnf --backup-dir=/backups/full copy-back-and-apply-log
```

#### Incremental Backup:
```bash
mysqlbackup --defaults-file=conf.cnf \
  --backup-dir=/backups/base \
  --incremental-backup-dir=/backups/inc1 \
  --incremental --incremental-base=dir:/backups/base backup
```

## 🔁 Incremental Restore Best Practice

- After performing **multiple incremental restores**, only run the `copy-back-and-apply-log` command **once**, on the **final set** of restored data.
- This ensures a **consistent** and **recoverable** state of the MySQL data.

---

## 📁 Configuration Files in Backup

- **`mysqld-auto.cnf`**  
  - Contains a **JSON-formatted** set of **persisted global variables**.
  - To use it on a restored server:  
    ➤ **Rename and relocate** to the appropriate MySQL config path.

- **`auto.cnf`**  
  - Stores the server’s **unique UUID**.
  - Do **not reuse** on replica instances.  
    ➤ MySQL will **automatically generate** a new one if it's missing.

---

## 📦 Backup Formats

- **Directory-Based Backups**  
  - Easier to **inspect**, **manage**, and **restore** individual files.
  
- **Image-Based Backups** (`--backup-to-image`)  
  - Packs all backup data into a **single file**.  
  - Ideal for **archiving** and **transferring** across environments.

---

## 🔐 Security and Optimization Features

- **Encryption**  
  - Use `--encrypt` with:
    - a string-based key  
    - or a **key file** generated by a secure algorithm  
  - 🔒 **Only applies to image backups**.

- **Compression**  
  - Enable with `--compress`.  
  - Supports **configurable levels**: higher levels save space, but consume more CPU.  
  - 📌 **Only works for InnoDB files**.

- **Media Management Support**  
  - Integrate with **SBT-compatible** storage solutions (e.g., **tape arrays**).

- **Network Storage Compatible**  
  - Backup targets can be **mounted NFS/Samba** shares.  
  - Enables backups in **multi-server and distributed** environments.

- **Timestamped Subdirectories**  
  - Use `--with-timestamp` to automatically:
    - Create **subdirectories** for each backup run  
    - Avoid overwriting and organize backups chronologically
