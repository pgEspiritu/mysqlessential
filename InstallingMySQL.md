## üêß Installing MySQL on Linux

### Installation Methods

1. **Using Package Managers (Simpler)**  
   - Example for Oracle Linux:
     ```bash
     yum install mysql-community-server
     yum install mysql-shell
     ```
   - Example for Debian-based systems:
     ```bash
     apt install mysql-server
     ```
   - Automatically installs dependencies and configures the system.

2. **Using Binary Archive (Advanced)**  
   - Install files manually and configure MySQL yourself.
   - Greater control, but more complex.

### Considerations

- **Distribution-specific behaviors**:
  - Some package names may refer to MySQL forks, not actual MySQL.
  - Official MySQL repository may need to be added manually.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `libaio`: For asynchronous I/O
  - `libtinfo`: For text display in terminal

- **Enterprise Edition**:
  - Not available via public repositories.
  - Must be downloaded locally.
  - You can create a private repository for internal use.

- Triggers
- Functions (SQL and MySQL-specific)

### User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
- External dynamically-loaded custom functions.
