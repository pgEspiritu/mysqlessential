# 🧰 MySQL Installation and Architecture

In this module, we cover how to install and configure MySQL, including preparing your environment, choosing the right edition, managing users, and understanding upgrade paths.

---

## 🖥️ Preparing Your Environment

MySQL runs on:

- ✅ Linux distributions
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)
- ✅ Cloud platforms (e.g., OCI with HeatWave)

🧠 **Performance Considerations**:

- Multithreading support
- NUMA support for large systems
- Efficient memory usage via InnoDB buffer pool
- SSD optimization for fast data access

🔁 **Redundancy Matters**:

- Use redundant power, storage, and network connections
- Avoid single points of failure

## 📦 Choosing the Right MySQL Edition

| Edition | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Community Edition** | Free, open-source version — most popular for web apps |
| **Enterprise Edition** | Commercial edition with full Oracle support |
| **Trial Edition** | Available at [edelivery.oracle.com](https://edelivery.oracle.com) |
| **Source Code** | Available at [mysql.com](https://mysql.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mysql) for developers |

## 🚀 Release Models

### 📆 Long-Term Support (LTS)
- Example: **MySQL 8.4**
- Feature-stable and production-ready
- Patches and fixes are backward-compatible
- Supported for up to **8 years**
- Released every **2 years**

### 🔁 Innovation Releases
- Delivers latest features **quarterly**
- Suitable for fast-moving development
- Must upgrade frequently
- Still production-ready, fully supported

✅ **All MySQL editions are available as both LTS and Innovation releases.**

## 🔗 Connectors and Compatibility

**Connectors** bridge your applications to MySQL:

- Production-ready and updated regularly
- Compatible with both LTS and Innovation versions
- Choose latest connector for best experience

---

## 📦 Containerization and Virtualization

- Use **Docker Hub** for Community images
- Use **Oracle Container Registry** or **Docker Store** for Enterprise
- MySQL integrates well with container platforms
