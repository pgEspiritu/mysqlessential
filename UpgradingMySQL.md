# 🔄 Upgrading MySQL

MySQL is continually evolving, so at some point, you may want or need to upgrade. This section highlights key points to consider when upgrading.

## 📦 Upgrade Basics

When upgrading MySQL:

- You **must shut down** the server to replace the binary executable files.
- You may need to update your configuration or data to match the new software version.

**Always backup your entire MySQL environment before upgrading**, including:
- Binary files
- Configuration files
- Triggers
- Stored procedures
- User settings
- Any other system-critical components

## 🛠️ Upgrade Methods

### 1. In-Place Upgrade

- **Steps**:
  1. Shut down the MySQL server.
  2. Replace binaries or install new ones in a new location.
  3. Update symbolic links if needed.
- **Behavior**:
  - The MySQL server detects the old data directory and performs necessary upgrade checks.

### 2. Logical Upgrade

- **Steps**:
  1. Backup your current server.
  2. Install the new MySQL version as a fresh install.
  3. Restore the backup into the new server.
- **Additional Tasks**:
  - Upgrade any connectors used by your applications.
  - Recompile applications with statically linked connectors.
  - Dynamically linked apps may work without recompilation.

### ✅ Bonus: Reduce Downtime

- Set up replication between old and new systems.
- Let the new system catch up.
- Redirect applications to the new system.

## 🔄 Upgrading from Community to Enterprise Edition

- Download the **Enterprise Edition** that matches your existing **Community Edition version**.
- Shut down the server.
- Remove Community binaries.
- Install Enterprise binaries.
- Restart the server — no upgrade steps needed if versions match.

## 🧪 Use Upgrade Checker

Each MySQL version includes a **Shell utility** to check upgrade readiness.

### Usage:
- Run `checkForServerUpgrade()`, specifying the target version and configuration.
- It checks for:
  - Reserved keyword usage
  - Deprecated or obsolete data types
  - Invalid or changed configuration parameters

> ⚠️ Note: The upgrade checker **does not** check for:
> - Deprecated function usage
> - GIS changes

### Required Privileges:
- `RELOAD`
- `PROCESS`
- `SELECT`
