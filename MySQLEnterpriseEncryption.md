## 🔐 MySQL Enterprise Encryption & Masking Features

Next, we'll go over some of the **encryption and masking features** available in MySQL Enterprise Edition.

### 🧊 Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

Transparent Data Encryption protects against **physical security disclosure**. For example:

- If someone gains access to database files (via OS vulnerability or device theft), **your data remains protected**.
- This is called **Data at Rest Encryption**.

#### 🔒 What is Protected?

- **Tablespaces**
- **Undo logs**
- **Redo logs**
- **Binary logs**
- **Relay logs**

Encryption uses **AES 256** algorithm.

#### 👨‍💻 Transparency

- **Client software, applications, and users** are unaffected.
- Applications **don’t need to change**.
- **DBAs** interact with the system the same way—indexes, views, procedures all work as usual.
- **No need for DBAs to access encryption keys**.

#### 🔑 Key Management

- Encryption keys must be safely stored and rotated.
- Common key management integrations include:
  - **KMIP**
  - **KMS**
  - **Oracle Key Vault**

> The **master key** is stored externally (e.g., Oracle Key Vault) and accessed via plugin.  
> Even if the database is compromised, the master key remains protected.

Each **encrypted tablespace** has its **own encryption key**, protected by the master key.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Data Masking & De-identification

A pluggable feature of MySQL Enterprise Edition that improves the security of **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** such as:

- Credit card numbers
- Government IDs
- Social security numbers

#### 🔄 Use Cases

- **Production database** stores full SSNs.
- **Analytics apps** only need existence of data, not actual values.
- **Dev/test environments** need data in correct form but not the real values.

#### 🔧 Example

Masked views can:
- **Randomize employee numbers**
- **Mask SSNs to a standard format**

#### 🧰 Masking Features

- Mask parts of a string using `X` or any placeholder.
- Use **dictionary tables** for replacement values.
- Built-in support for:
  - US Social Security Numbers
  - UK National Insurance Numbers
  - Canadian SINs
  - Credit card & IBAN numbers

#### 🎲 Random Data Generation

Useful for **testing**:
- Random numbers in a range
- Fake email addresses
- Valid credit card / SSN formats
- Random values from dictionary tables

## ✅ Summary

In this module, we've discussed several **MySQL Enterprise tools** that enhance security and compliance:

- **MySQL Enterprise Audit** – track user activity and access
- **MySQL Enterprise Firewall** – prevent SQL injection and unauthorized queries
- **Transparent Data Encryption** – protect data at rest
- **Data Masking & De-identification** – secure sensitive personal data

These features improve **compliance**, **security**, and **operational efficiency** in enterprise MySQL environments.
